This project was created to fulfill course requirements for INSC 565 Digital Libraries, part of the Master of Science in Information Sciences (MSIS) program at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. It was developed by Brady Allen, Hayden Fuller, and Loren Moulds.

The University of Virginia (UVA) Law Library possesses a unique collection of student notebooks that spans nearly two centuries of legal education. These notebooks offer an intimate glance into the academic and intellectual life at the Law School, revealing the evolution of legal thought and pedagogical methods through time. Our project took this digitized, but largely uncatalogued, collection of student notebooks and transformed it into a digital library meant to preserve these fragile and unique documents and to make them accessible to a wider audience. We designed this initiative to provide access to a segment of the Law Library's collection that has, to date, been largely inaccessible to a broader audience due to its physical form, geographic isolation, and fragility of its components. By digitizing these notebooks, we aim to preserve their content for future generations ensuring that the rich history they embody is not confined to the shelves of the Law library.

The notebooks in question are a window into the past, providing insight into the evolution of legal education and thought as it has unfolded at UVA. They contain lecture notes, personal reflections, and scholarly discussions, offering a tangible link to the pedagogical approaches and academic environment of the Law School across different eras. The process of digitization and adding them to a digital library will not only protect these documents from wear but will also facilitate their integration into current and future scholarly work by making them easily accessible online.

This report will outline our efforts to create a prototype digital library using CollectionBuilder (CB) an open-source framework for creating digital collections and digital exhibitions ([https://collectionbuilder.github.io/](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/)) using the student notebooks held at the Law Library. The report describes the stages of the project, including a community analysis, collection development guidelines, metadata dictionary, a technical infrastructure description, and a final reflection on the successes and challenges of the project including a critical analysis of CB as a digital library platform. 


# Community Analysis

This digital library will focus on a collection of law notebooks written by students. The purpose behind this collection is to allow a broader range of those interested in law to access these historical notebooks without worry about damaging the original resources, allow ease of access, and offer a glimpse into the past making clear the past insights of law and the law curriculum and how that information compares to today. The primary users of this library will be all sorts of law experts, most likely students, staff, and alumni, as well as legal scholars and historians.  What these notebooks hope to provide is a window into the past, presenting a continuous narrative of legal education’s development at the University of Virginia. These documents are significant for researchers delving into the historical progression of legal doctrines and educational strategies by offering a rich, unbroken line of inquiry from the early days of the institution to the present.

There are many benefits to having this digital library. Law students, alumni, and faculty at University of Virginia will benefit from its resources because the notebooks provide a way to connect and engage with the historical roots of their school and profession since the digital collection of these notebooks offers an easily accessible gateway to how the past minds of the legal studies and profession engaged with the laws of their time period. Such an easily accessible resource is invaluable for the present law students, alumni, faculty, and more to be able to visually see how the past has progressed into the future, which will provide a sense of continuity and evolution within their discipline. By creating this readily, easily accessible collection, those interested in law studies and law in general have an opportunity to enhance their knowledge on the laws of the past compared to those of today, and can even trace the past to the laws of the present day. Not only will the past be able to be traced by reading the shifts in laws from time period to time period, but the courses being taught at those times can also be noted by the notes which the students took in those courses as well.

The overarching goal of this digital library containing the law student notebooks is meant to provide an in-depth exploration of legal education’s response to doctrinal shifts without the additional context of broader institutional materials. With this more concentrated approach, a clearer, more detailed look at the academic journey through the eyes of the students’ themselves will hopefully reveal the changes in the context and structure of legal education as if directly experienced in the classroom. The goal of this digital library collection is meant to preserve the past, making the physical notebooks much more easily accessible and available to a public who may need them, but also to offer insights into the past and be able to draw comparisons to the knowledge of both the workings of law and the great minds of the present day and beyond. Through this resource, the notebooks are more likely to survive and be preserved successfully into the distant future, as well.

The needs of our users will mostly be met by maintaining an easily accessible, quickly loading and generating digital library which is as accurate, fleshed out, as parameters make possible. This means having reliable information for the documents, having a great search option to shift through documents quickly and accurately meets requests, simple interface that is easy to use and understand, excellent metadata and data, etc. It is important for users to be able to access both textual information and the images provided through the collection. The time period, author, and a title of the notebooks are some of the textual parameters to provide an easily locatable document for the users.  

With the notebooks presented in a digital format, the library ensures that these historical documents on legal education are not only preserved, but also made accessible for both contemporary and future inquiry. The digital format also allows for an examination of the pedagogical shifts over time, offering a singular narrative thread that traces the evolution of legal thought and practice. Therefore, the digital library stands to be a useful educational and research tool. It holds the promise of deepening the understanding of legal education’s past for those who are shaping its future, serving as an essential asset for a legal community that values its heritage as a guide for progression. It will also facilitate a deeper appreciation for the tradition and transformation of legal pedagogy, making it a unique and focused asset for legal historians, educators, and students alike.

# Technology Infrastructure

The technology infrastructure supporting the UVA Law Student Notebooks Digital Library is critical in ensuring that this valuable historical collection is preserved, accessible, and useful for educational and research purposes. This report provides a detailed overview of the various technological components involved in the digitization, cataloging, and online presentation of the UVA Law Student Notebooks collection. It covers the complete workflow from physical notebook to digital archive, including the creation and maintenance of a public-facing digital library platform.


## Digitization Equipment and Workflow

The digitization strategy this collection employs imaging technology to ensure high-quality digital reproductions. Primary digitization is conducted using an Atiz Mark 2 scanner equipped with dual Canon EOS 5DS R medium-format cameras, capturing images at a minimum of 400 DPI. For materials that are oversized, fragile, or require special handling, a Hasselblad H6D camera is used to ensure adequate image quality. The process involves careful preparation and assessment of each item, followed by digitization in a controlled environment to minimize physical stress on the originals. Post-digitization, each image undergoes rigorous quality control to verify resolution, clarity, color accuracy, and completeness, with subsequent adjustments and processing to optimize images for archival storage and digital accessibility. This approach not only preserves the historical integrity of the notebooks but also enhances their accessibility for research and educational use.


## Cataloging Metadata in ArchivesSpace

Once digitized, each notebook is cataloged in ArchivesSpace ([https://archivesspace.org/](https://archivesspace.org/)), a widely used archival information management system. This system allows the library to create detailed records for each digital object, which includes descriptive, administrative, and technical metadata. These records are crucial for both internal management and external discoverability of the collection.

The metadata schema adheres to DACS standards ([https://www2.archivists.org/groups/technical-subcommittee-on-describing-archives-a-content-standard-dacs/describing-archives-a-content-standard-dacs-second-](https://www2.archivists.org/groups/technical-subcommittee-on-describing-archives-a-content-standard-dacs/describing-archives-a-content-standard-dacs-second-)), ensuring that each entry includes information such as title, author (student), date of creation, and a brief description of the content. This process is essential for integrating the digital objects into the broader UVA archival system, making them accessible to researchers and the public through unified search platforms.


## Access Image Management in IIIF

Integration with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) allows for robust management and display of the digital images. After cataloging, the high-resolution images are uploaded to a IIIF-compliant server ([https://iiif.io/](https://iiif.io/)). This server facilitates the delivery of images in a manner that supports deep zooming and manipulation without requiring the original high-resolution files to be downloaded to the user's device. 

Under typically installations, CB is meant to display single objects or simple compound objects. The notebooks in this collection universally contain numerous pages. CB does not natively handle many hundred-page objects well. IIIF-compliant image viewers seamlessly allow for viewing and navigating many-paged, complex compound digital objects with minimal scripting and display code. Integrating a IIIF viewer into CB solves this limitation.

To interface with the IIIF API, we create manifests for each notebook. These manifests are structured documents that define the sequence and presentation of images, making it possible to view the digital notebooks in a book-like format with page-turning functionality. This capability significantly enhances the user experience by mimicking the physical handling of a notebook.


## Creating CSV for CollectionBuilder

To integrate with CollectionBuilder—a static site generator for digital collections—we first prepare a CSV file that includes all the metadata from ArchivesSpace along with links to the IIIF manifests. The CSV file acts as the backbone of the CB site, linking all digital objects with their descriptive records and ensuring that the digital library is navigable and searchable.

The preparation of the CSV involves exporting data from ArchivesSpace, then enriching and adapting it to fit the CB schema. This includes ensuring that fields such as image URLs, titles, dates, and descriptions are correctly formatted and that the CSV is validated to prevent errors during the site building process.


## Creating CollectionBuilder Site Locally Using Code Builder

With the CSV file prepared, the next step is to set up the CB environment locally using Visual Studio Code, a development environment that supports web projects. This local setup allows for the customization and testing of the digital library before it goes live. Developers use this environment to implement design choices, integrate additional functionalities, and ensure that the site’s navigation and user interface meet project specifications.

During this phase, the team builds the on layout, functionality, and aesthetic aspects of the digital library, making use of CB’s flexible templating system. Local development ensures that any issues can be addressed without affecting the live site, providing a safe space for creative and technical experimentation.


## Customization of CollectionBuilder Setup

In order to integrate IIIF served images into CB we needed to follow several custom adjustments eto setup CB to manage and display the digitized notebooks.

This setup required ensuring CB hosted IIIF manifest JSON files for each digitized object. These manifests are vital for integrating with IIIF viewers, as they describe the structure and presentation of images that form the digital notebooks. To streamline the organization and reference within the CollectionBuilder setup, we adopted a uniform naming convention: each `manifest.json` is named `{objectid}_manifest.json`, corresponding to the object's unique identifier in the metadata. These files are stored within an 'objects' directory in the CB code, and their locations are recorded in the metadata field `object_location` with the relative file path `objects/{objectid}_manifest.json`. This approach ensures a clear structure and easy maintenance of the IIIF manifests within the digital library system.

Additionally, we created a custom layout designed to render object pages with an embedded Universal Viewer ([https://universalviewer.io/](https://universalviewer.io/)), which significantly improves the user's ability to interact with the digital objects. In the metadata, this layout is triggered when the `display_template` field value is set to `iiif_manifest`. This value instructs the system to use a different rendering template compared to other display types like `image`, `video`, or `pdf`. 

The standard CB CSV installation provides a generic item code segment for loading and displaying objects within the Universal Viewer. However, a custom display template was needed to utilize this functionality effectively. By defining this field and the conditions under which it embeds and populates Universal Viewer, we ensure that each item is presented in the most engaging and informative way possible, with tools like deep zoom and page navigation that enhance the digital browsing experience. 

We added the `manifest.json` files directly into CB’s objects folder. This allowed the hosted manifests to be pulled directly into the Universal Viewer without requesting remote URLs, creating a seamless and direct connection between the metadata and manifests. The custom item field in the CollectionBuilder configuration file was crucial for activating the correct item code segment, allowing for a tailored presentation of the notebooks.

These customizations have been a significant advancement and provide a robust and scalable solution for displaying digitized content using IIIF. These enhancements to the infrastructure ensure that users have a rich and intuitive experience while exploring the historical documents, and they highlight the adaptability of CB to meet specific archival and presentation needs.


## Versioning, Deployment, and Hosting Using GitHub Pages

Once the CollectionBuilder site is finalized and tested locally, it is deployed using GitHub Pages. This platform hosts the static site directly from a GitHub repository, providing a stable, scalable, and cost-effective hosting solution. The use of GitHub also facilitates version control and collaboration, allowing multiple team members to work on the site simultaneously, track changes, and roll back to previous versions if necessary.

GitHub Pages integrates with CollectionBuilder, allowing for continuous updates to the digital library as new notebooks are digitized and added to the collection. The maintenance of the site, including updates to the CSV file and adjustments to the site design or functionality, is managed through the GitHub interface, ensuring that the digital library remains current and functional.

Importantly, because CB-generated sites generate static codebases and can point to remotely hosted digital objects, the storage needs in GitHub are small which allows us to host the digital library at no cost for this project.
